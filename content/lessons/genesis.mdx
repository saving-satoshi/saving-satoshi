# Find block 0

Let's find the very first block in the Bitcoin blockchain. Go to a block explorer and search for '0'. This will take you to the block at height 0. As you can see, this block only contains one transaction.

Open up the transaction so you can take a closer look at the details. On the left is an input called 'Coinbase'. Inside that is a field called 'ScriptSig'. Find the HEX representation and paste it below.

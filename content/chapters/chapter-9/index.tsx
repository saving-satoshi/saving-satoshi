        During the festivities, you get a strange text. It’s from a number you
        don’t recognize. The message tells you to run and hide. Vanderpoole and
        his henchmen have figured where you are, and they’re coming to steal
        your bitcoin.

      <Text>
        Don’t panic, you tell yourself. Think. What kind of trap can you set for
        them?

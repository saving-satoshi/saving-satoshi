# Translating Saving Satoshi

We use [Github](https://github.com/saving-satoshi/saving-satoshi) for managing Saving Satoshi's translations.

## For Developers

Our source language, i.e. the language we develop in, is English.
Any missing translations will fall back to using the English translation.
If you add text to the app, make sure not to use plain language in source files.
Instead add any strings to the English translation file:

```
i18n/locales/en/translations.ts
```

### Example

To begin you will need to add your choice locale in the `/i18n/config.ts` file as below.

Config File:

```jsx
// i18n/config.ts
export const i18n = {
  defaultLocale: 'en',
  locales: ['en', 'nl', 'ko'],
} as const
```
Then you may begin adding your own translations to test as you go.

Source File:

```jsx
// components/HelloWorld.tsx

import React from 'react'
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'

export default function HelloWorldComponent() {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  return <h1>{t('hello_world.heading')}</h1>
}
```

Be sure to add your copy directly to the `translation.ts` file and not the component when creating new components.

Translation file:

```jsx
// i18n/locales/en/translation.ts

export const translations = {
    hello_world: {
        ko: {
            heading: "안녕 세상!"
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding a new Language

To add a new language:

1. Look in the `/i18n/locales/` folder to determine if there is any existing translation.
1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/saving-satoshi/saving-satoshi/issues/new/choose) detailing the language and scope you wish to add to on Github.
1. [Add it](https://github.com/saving-satoshi/saving-satoshi/compare) on Github.
1. Invite some review and get it merged!
